//Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadthward motion,
// meaning it explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the next level.
// It is often used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph or to visit all nodes in a connected component of a graph.

//in this code:
//
//We define a Graph class with methods to add edges (addEdge) and perform BFS (BFS).
//
//We maintain a visited array to keep track of visited vertices to avoid processing them more than once.
//
//We use a queue to keep track of the vertices to be processed in BFS order.
//
//The BFS function starts at a given startVertex, marks it as visited, and enqueues it.
//
//It then enters a loop where it dequeues a vertex, prints it, and enqueues its unvisited neighbors.
//
//The process continues until the queue is empty.
