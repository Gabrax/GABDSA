/*In C++, a hash map is a data structure that contains a collection of unique elements in the form of key-value pairs. 
Elements of a hash map are identified by key values, while the mapped values are the content associated with the keys.

Each element of a map or unordered_map is an object of type pair. A pair object has two member variables:
The following methods apply to both unordered_map and map:

.insert(): add an element to the map.
.erase(): removes an element from the map.
.count(): check whether an element exists in the map.
.size(): return the size of the map.
[] operator:
If the specified key matches an element in the map, then access the mapped value associated with that key.
If the specified key doesnâ€™t match any element in the map, add a new element to the map with that key.

std::map is typically implemented as a self-balancing binary search tree (usually a Red-Black Tree).
This ensures that the elements are always sorted by their keys.
std::unordered_map, on the other hand, is implemented as a hash table. 
It does not maintain any particular order of elements; instead, it provides fast access to elements using a hash function.*/

  country_codes["Thailand"] = 66; // Access an element
  
  country_codes.erase("Peru");
  
  // Outputs: There isn't a code for Belgium
  if (country_codes.count("Belgium")) {
    std::cout << "There is a code for Belgium\n";
  }
